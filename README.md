# Dog Fortress

## Overview
**Dog Fortress** is to be a simulation-like game (or rather a game-like simulation, since there is no winning).
It stems inspiration from games such as Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, Spore, and The Sims, among other simulation-styled games.

The gameplay revolves around managing a colony of dogs (subject to change), each of which having its own needs, personality,
and characteristics. The player can designate overall jobs for the colony to complete
such as mining, cutting down trees, building, crafting, harvesting, etc. (some incomplete).
Then, the dogs will attempt to complete the jobs based on their assigned labors.

The graphics for my game are tileset-based allowing for me to focus on implementing gameplay mechanics and good coding practice.

## Building Dog Fortress
All the files needed to build **Dog Fortress** can be found in `src`.
The executable needs to be located two directories up from the resources folder or the game
will not find any textures properly.
